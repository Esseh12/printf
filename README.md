# Project name

printf project is an alx group project by Gbenmo Ese and Reagan Otim, started on november 10, 2023 at 6:00am.

It is a printf function written in C programming language.

The printf function in C is used for formatted output. It’s part of the Standard Input/Output Library (stdio.h) and is responsible for printing data to the standard output (typically the console) in a specified format. It’s an essential tool for displaying information to users and debugging programs.

The Format String:
At the core of printf is the format string. This string contains both text and format specifiers, which are placeholders for the values you want to print. Format specifiers start with a ‘%’ character, followed by a character that indicates the type of data to be printed (e.g., %d for integers, %s for strings).

Here’s a simple example:

int age = 30;
printf("I am %d years old.", age);
In this example, "I am %d years old." is the format string, and %d is the format specifier. The %d specifier tells printf to expect an integer value, which is provided as age.

The printf function processes the format string, replacing format specifiers with the actual values you provide as arguments.

## Installation

To use printf in your c project you do not need to install anything extra :)
follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   	git clone https://github.com/Esseh12/printf.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
	cd printf

3. compile the project using a C compiler. for example if you are using GCC, run the command:
	gcc printf.c -o printf

4. Run the compilled executable:
./project


## Usage

1. Function Signature: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
2. Format Specifiers: Explain the supported format specifiers and their corresponding data types. For example:
. %d for integers
. %f for floating-point numbers
. %s for strings
. %c for characters
. %x for hexadecimal numbers
4. Build and run your Cprogram using a C compiler.
 	gcc main.c printf.c -o program
5. Execute the compiled program:
	./program
Congratulations! You have successfully used the [Project Name] printf project to print formatted output in your C program.

Feel free to customize this template and provide any additional instructions or options specific to your printf project.
